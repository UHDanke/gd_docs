# Bugs

### Criteria for bugs

The way i classify a certain behavior as a bug is entirely subjective, but there are two main criterias i follow:

1. Does it seem intentional?  
2. Is it detrimental and would it be more useful if it was fixed?

If i don't classify something as a bug, it is either because i find the feature useful, i consider the behavior a non-issue or it's just how it works.  
Crashes are always bugs without question.

### Last checked version

For record keeping, each bug will have the last verified version prefixed to the title (ex: \[2.207\] Crash bug).  
I will only update the version number if i encounter the bug again or retest it for a new version.
