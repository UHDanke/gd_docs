# Color Sliders

The initial RGBA values of a color channel and the HSV values of a selected object, Color trigger or Pulse trigger can be modified using sliders from the Color / HSV overlay.

This overlay pops up when clicking the HSV / Colors button found below Copy Values.

For the color sliders, the current color and the initial color are previewed next to each other.

The overlay does not get hidden during playtesting, which allows you to change values while playing the level in the editor.
