# Suggestions

While suggestions do not fall under documentation, i think that they still hold some relevance as to what the limitations of the current features are and what are the rough points that could be improved in future versions of the game.

I would like to keep feedback separate from documentation, but most of them don't make sense outside of this context, so i've split them into their own folder.
If i were to put them anywhere else they aren't going to get looked at let alone considered, so realistically this is the only format that makes sense to me to make suggestions to the game.
Bug reports and suggestions have been a pain point for both Rob and players from almost the beginning as there is no framework to handle public feedback and reports.

I have a pretty good understanding of how most trigger-related features work so generally my suggestions are going to be similar to how existing features already function or extensions of existing features.
It can be a bit difficult to flesh out ideas as the game's way to program things is quite different from what most people are used to.
For me the workflow is very similar to how some low level industrial programming languages work as each trigger is it's own encapsulated function, this is what i personally have experience with and can draw parallels to.
Odd as it is, i quite like how the game implements triggers and i see no reason to change or abstract game features further.
