# BPM Guide

Displays song lines synced to a beat given in **BPM** (bars per minute) multiplied by **BPB** (beats per bar) for a **Duration** given in seconds, relative to a given gameplay Speed.

## Behavior

Bars are colored yellow, beats are orange.

Unlike song guidelines, BPM guidelines are not affected by any gameplay changes.

It is not possible to orient BPM triggers in any direction other than left to right.

## Visibility

Toggling off song guidelines does not toggle off BPM guidelines.

BPM guidelines are not toggled off if the trigger is toggled off or has its alpha set to 0.

The only ways to hide them is either with the Disable option or with the Hide object option (if Hide Invisible is ticked on).
