# Main Song

The default song used when playing the level, which can be changed from the level select menu. This will be displayed as the main song in any level select screen.

It is always played on **Channel** 0 and is loaded on level start.

## Song Selection

### Normal Songs

In the Normal category you can find all of the official, main-level songs for use in your custom levels.

It is not possible to use main level songs inside Song triggers (they can only be used as primary songs), but non-cut versions of some of them can be found on Newgrounds.

### Custom Songs
Custom songs can be chosen from two main sources - Newgrounds and the Audio Library.

Newgrounds is a media-hosting website for user-generated content. While possible to use your own music in-game, you first need to be scouted in order to appear in the Audio Portal and then whitelisted by RobTop.

The Audio Library hosts audio licensed for use inside Geometry Dash. This can be either on a per artist or per label basis, but not all songs from an artist or label can be featured as the usage rights can be owned by a different entity or exclusive to another game.

## Settings

The primary song settings menu can be accessed from the gear button in the Custom Song Selection menu. 

While the options can only be accessed from the custom song menu, these settings also apply to main level songs.

### Offset

Offsets the start of the song by a value given in seconds. 

This is less precise than the song trigger, as you can modify the offset only up to a tenth of a second, instead of a thousandth.

Offset is ignored if using Dont Reset.

### Fade In/Out

Applies one second of fade when starting from the beginning of the level (Fade In) and / or when completing the level (Fade Out).

Fades are not applied while playtesting in the editor

### Dont Reset

Similar to the option found in the Song trigger, songs will continue when dying or resetting the level.

Unlike the Song trigger option, it does not stop on death and will not reset when restarting from the beginning of the level.
