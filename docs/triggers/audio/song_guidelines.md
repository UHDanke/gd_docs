# Song Guidelines

Song guidelines are editor-only lines used as reference for syncing triggers and gameplay to the song.

They can be toggled on or off using the Music Lines option in the editor pause screen, next to the Help button.

Guidelines are only displayed vertically, so they will not show up in vertical gameplay sections.

## Guideline Creator

Song guidelines can be created for custom levels using the Guideline Creator accessed from inside the Custom Song Selection menu.

New guidelines can be added to existing ones from the Record button. Existing ones can be cleared with the Clear button.

Custom guidelines are saved per level, not per song.

## Normal Songs 

Main level songs all have beat guidelines which cannot be edited in-game.

Audio-scaled objects do not sync to the main level song, they use the guideline beats as reference.
