# Change Ground

Changes the level's Ground to a different preset. There are currently 22 Ground presets.

3 Line options exist, but the trigger cannot currently set them.

Only one Ground change can be made per render frame. The first will trigger, while any other subsequent Ground trigger is ignored until the next frame.
