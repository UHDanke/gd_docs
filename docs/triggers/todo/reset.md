# Reset

Resets objects from a **Group ID** that have been activated, picked up or destroyed.

Reset only makes the target able to be activated again, it does not undo any of their effects.

Reset works on the following:
- Collectibles (all, except user coins)
- Destroyable blocks
- Checkpoints

Reset does not work on triggers, even if they cannot be multi-activated.

Due to a bug, collectibles that have been collected then reset in classic mode cannot be picked up again.
