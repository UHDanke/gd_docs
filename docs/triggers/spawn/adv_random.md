# Advanced Random Trigger

Spawns one group ID at random from several group IDs.

The probability a group is chosen is proportional to its random weight, divided by the sum of all random weights. This probability is displayed next to each group as a percentage.

## Menu

Groups can be added by using **Add**. **Chance** sets the random weight of the group. If the group already exists then **Chance** will increase the existing weight.

Clicking on a group removes it from the trigger.
