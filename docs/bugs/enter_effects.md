# Enter Effects

## [2.207] Enter trigger crash

If you try to call 2 different Enter triggers with the same Enter Channel and Effect IDs but different values for the same variables, the game will crash in playtesting.

## [2.207] Enter trigger portals

Using Enter trigger effects on portals and other objects composed of multiple objects only affects the foreground layer of portal objects.

## [2.207] Legacy Enter triggers cannot be spawned

Legacy (pre-2.2) Enter triggers cannot be spawned with the Spawn Trigger option.
Touch Trigger does work however.
