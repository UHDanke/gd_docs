# HDanke's Geometry Dash Editor Documentation

These are my personal notes documenting various Geometry Dash triggers and editor mechanics.  
They are not intended as a guide or introduction to the game or the editor, read the [Official Editor Guide](https://www.robtopgames.com/files/GDEditor.pdf) first if you are a beginner.  
Everything in this document has been deduced using in-game tests. As such, there might be factual errors or misinterpretations despite rigorous testing.  
I made these notes for me to have a reference i can check anytime. I can understand them, i cannot guarantee you will.

Report any issues or suggestions by raising an issue on this github repo.

### Bugs {#bugs}

For the purposes of debugging, i keep track of all bugs i find and figure out the cause of.  
The [Bugs](#bugs) file has links to all other files that contain bug reports, as well as a list of miscellaneous bugs.  
I take trigger / editor related bug reports in order to document them. **I can not fix bugs and have no way of sending bug reports to the developer of the game.**

### Suggestions {#suggestions}

The [Suggestions](?tab=t.w5fuqbmeupk) tab has links to all other tabs that contain suggestions.  
Additionally, if a suggested feature is expansive enough (ex. a new trigger) it gets its own document that goes more in detail to the purpose of the feature and why i think it is necessary.

### Referencing 

If you are working on your own guides you are free to use this as reference, but please do not copy or bundle my work.  
I ask you to credit me and this document if your work relies heavily on it. Do not obfuscate, hide or make the credit or link hard to see.

### Future Plans

While i would like to keep updating the docs for as long as the game will continue to be around, i think it's inevitable that i will eventually move on to other things. Before then, i'd like to at least get everything i know written down so i have something to come back to when i regain interest, hopefully it still remains relevant by then.

I plan on getting these tabs in good shape soon:

* Counters & Timers  
* Spawn Mechanics  
* Collisions

I plan on working on these tabs after that:

* Misc Triggers  
* Advanced Follow  
* Particles  
* Keyframes  
* Move Mechanics
