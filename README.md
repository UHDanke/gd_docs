# HDanke's Geometry Dash Editor Documentation

These are my personal notes documenting various Geometry Dash triggers and editor mechanics.  
They are not intended as a guide or introduction to the game or the editor, read the [Official Editor Guide](https://www.robtopgames.com/files/GDEditor.pdf) first if you are a beginner.  
Everything in this document has been deduced using in-game tests. As such, there might be factual errors or misinterpretations despite rigorous testing.  
I made these notes for me to have a reference i can check anytime. I can understand them, i cannot guarantee you will.

Report any issues or suggestions by raising an issue on this repo. I don't check github often, any responses and fixes may take a couple days / weeks.

### Bugs

In order to aid with debugging, i keep track of all bugs i find and figure out the cause of.  
You can find lists of bugs i have found in the bugs folder, split by trigger type.

I am interested in trigger / editor related bug reports for the purpose of documentation only.  
If you found a bug you can raise an issue and i can take a look at it, but i give no guarantees.  
I will not debug your trigger setups, this is not my job and i do not want to do free QA or volunteer work.
Any issues with bugs outside this scope will be closed or ignored.

**I can not fix bugs and have no direct way of sending bug reports to the developer of the game. This is not an official bug report channel.**

### Suggestions

The bugs folder contains lists of the suggestions i have for existing features or triggers, as well as new functionality that i have come up with to cover existing technical limitations.  
If a suggested feature is expansive enough (ex. a new trigger) it gets its own document that goes more in detail to the purpose of the feature and why i think it is necessary.

### Referencing 

If you are working on your own guides you are free to use this as reference, but please do not copy or bundle my work.  
I ask you to credit me and this document if your work relies heavily on it. Do not obfuscate, hide or make the credit or link hard to see.
