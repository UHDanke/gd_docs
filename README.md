# HDanke's Geometry Dash Editor Documentation

The website can now be found [>> HERE <<](https://uhdanke.github.io/gd_docs/)

These are my personal notes documenting various Geometry Dash triggers and editor mechanics, they are not intended as a guide or introduction to the game or the editor.

Most of the information in this document has been deduced using in-game tests. As such, there might be errors or misinterpretations despite extensive testing.

I made these notes for me to have a reference i can check anytime. I can understand them, i cannot guarantee you will.

Report any issues or suggestions by raising an issue on this repo.
