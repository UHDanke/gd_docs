# Shake

Applies a shaking effect to the screen.

## Behavior

Shakes the screen by moving the view on both X and Y axes by a random offset multiplied by **Strength**. The view is offset every **Interval** until Duration runs out.

UI, Background and Middleground will not move at all. Ground will only move vertically.

Only one shake effect can be active at a time and new shakes override previous ones. This includes the on death shake as well, which can be overriden.

### Options

Strength and Duration must both be bigger than 0 for the shake to trigger. 

If Interval is 0, the view will offset every render frame. 

The lowest value of Strength that can be used is 0.01, which is low enough to be imperceptible.

The max values of a Shake trigger are Strength 100, Interval 0.20s and Duration 10.00s.

All shaking effects can be disabled using the "Disable Shake" level option.

Editor only object which displays a reference outline for the camera's edges.

## Color Guide

The yellow line shows the Player's X position relative to the camera center.

The green outline shows the camera's minimum guaranteed coverage.

The orange outline shows the camera's coverage for the current resolution.

## Options

**Zoom** changes the referenced zoom level for the guide.

**Offset X** and **Offset Y** offset the guide from the center object by a small step unit amount.

**Preview Opacity** modifies the opacity of the camera outlines.

## Notes

Camera Guides cannot be rotated in any way.

The position of the yellow line is updated only while playtesting.

Camera Guide objects are often used as reference for triggers such as Static Camera and UI.
